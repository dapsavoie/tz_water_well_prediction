This repository is structured in 3 key parts. 

1. EDA and Preliminary Data Cleaning - This is a quick process to identify issues with the data and developed a framework to address to maximize success of analysis and reflect on ways to structure business intelligence processes down the line. 

2. Cleaning & Encoding - standardized process to make sure the same dataset is fed into different algorithims. Modular approaches to steps of cleaning make life simpler for data scientists and ensure a validity of results over multiple models. 

3. Models and results - Xgboost performed the best with high results SMOTE reduced the accuracy so the 'vanilla' xgboost performed the best.
